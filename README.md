# 📊 Ecommerce Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Online Retail Dataset (Kaggle)** using:
- **SQL** for structured queries and data analysis
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced analytics

It demonstrates data cleaning, sales insights, customer behavior analysis, and business intelligence workflows.
